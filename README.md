#LD33
Hello. You have stumbled upon my game for LD33. I don't have a name for it yet, but it can easily be installed.
## Install instructions
To install, you will need [python3](http://python.org) and [pygame](http://pygame.org/download.shtml).

After you have Python3 and PyGame, clone the repository in a directory of your choice. To clone a repository, you will need
git. After git is installed, run the following to clone the repository:

`$ git clone http://github.com/pta2002/LD33.git`

You should now have some files on your current directory. The game is now downloaded!

## Running the game
To run the game, open a terminal/command prompt on the directory to which you downloaded the game and run:

`$ python main.py`

If you have multiple versions of Python installed, run the following on Linux/OS X:

`$ python3 main.py`

...and the following if you are on Windows:

`> C:\Python34\python main.py`

Replace `C:\Python34\` with your Python 3 install directory
